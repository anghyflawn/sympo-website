## About ##

What do we need to consider in order to understand phonological change and to reconstruct past phonological states? The Second Edinburgh Symposium on Historical Phonology will offer an opportunity to discuss fundamental questions in historical phonology as well as specific analyses of historical data.

The symposium will be hosted by the [Department of Linguistics and English Language](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk) on the 3rd and 4th December, 2015, with support from the [Angus McIntosh Centre for Historical Linguistics](http://www.ppls.ed.ac.uk/lel/groups/angus-mcintosh-centre-for-historical-linguistics).

The Angus McIntosh Centre for Historical Linguistics' Plenary Speaker for 2015 is [Ranjan Sen](https://www.shef.ac.uk/english/people/sen), University of Sheffield. We also gratefully acknowledge support from the [Linguistics Association of Great Britain](http://www.lagb.org.uk).
