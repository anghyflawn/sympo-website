The conference dates are 3rd--4th December 2015. As last year, the
conference will take place in the
[Informatics Forum](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/informatics/about/location)
and the
[Dugald Stewart Building](http://www.ed.ac.uk/maps?building=dugald-stewart-building),
both part of the university's central area. We expect to organise a
wine reception for delegates and a pay-your-own-way dinner. The fee is
£10.

Edinburgh is well connected through
[Edinburgh Airport](http://www.edinburghairport.com/) and the
[UK rail system](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/), and the university’s
central area is easily accessible, on the edge of Edinburgh’s
remarkable Old Town, a few minutes’ walk from the Royal Mile.
[Edinburgh](http://www.edinburgh.org/) is the ancient capital of
Scotland, and its Old Town and (18th century) New Town form a large
[UNESCO World Heritage Site](http://www.ewht.org.uk/). The University
is easily accessible from anywhere in the city, and is within walking
distance of the train station and all the city centre shops and
restaurants.

## Presenter information ##

If you are bringing handouts, we expect that no one session will have
more than 65 people in it.

If you are presenting a poster, each presenter will have their own
poster board, and the dimensions are roughly the same size as A0
(2.759 x 3.901 ft). Apparently, A0 poster edges may go over the frame
slightly, but this should not be a problem. There are special sticky
backed strips/spots to hang the posters up, and we will aim to provide
these. We recommend landscape, *not* portrait.


## Getting to the symposium from the airport and city centre ##

For most people, travelling to the Symposium will involve either
flying into or getting the train to Edinburgh and then either walking
or getting a bus or a taxi to the conference venue (or to your
accommodation first, perhaps). It’s easy to get into the city centre
from [Edinburgh airport](http://www.edinburghairport.com/): use the
[number 100 Airlink](http://lothianbuses.com/services/airlink) bus
which leaves every few minutes and which drops you off next to the
main train station (this is the last stop on the bus journey). This
station (called Waverley Station) is where most intercity trains
terminate, too. Another option is the
[Edinburgh Trams](http://www.edinburghtrams.com). In the city centre,
the tram stops at Haymarket Station (there are some hotels in that
area and around the nearby financial district), Shandwick Place (the
stop is called West End --- Princes Street), around the middle of
Princes Street, St Andrew Square, and York Place on the edge of the
New Town (quite close to the YHA hostel if that's where you're
staying).

Waverley station is a good orientation point – it’s situated right in
the centre of the city, between the New Town and the Old Town, just
next to Princes Street (Princes Street is the main central shopping
street in Edinburgh), and there are normally lots of taxis available
at the station (if you want to take a taxi to the conference venue,
ask them to take to the Informatics Forum at the University, next to
Bristo Square). It’s about 15 minutes’ walk from the station to the
University. You need to head south: walk up from the station into the
Old Town along Cockburn Street and then up the Royal Mile and along George IV Bridge.

The Informatics Forum is shown on a map
[here](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/informatics/about/location).

## Accommodation ##

If you need to book accommodation for the symposium, we recommend trying the [Kenneth Mackenzie Suite](http://www.edinburghfirst.co.uk/for-accommodation/kenneth-mackenzie) or [Richmond Apartments]( http://www.edinburghfirst.co.uk/for-accommodation/richmond-place-apartments) (these are both affiliated to the university and are close to the symposium venue and city centre). The university also has some [other types of accommodation](http://www.book.accom.ed.ac.uk/) at other nearby locations, which may also be worth investigating.

If they are full, or you’d like to stay somewhere more luxurious or
cheaper, the easiest way to find somewhere is to use one of the many
internet accommodation search sites. If you try
[Trip Advisor](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk), you’ll find lots of
details and some interesting comments about the hotels (not always to
be trusted, but you can probably go by the average opinion). Enter
your check-in and check-out dates, select the number of adults staying
in the room and click on ‘find hotels’. You can select the currency
that you’d like to use and you can ‘sort by’ price or popularity. If
you click on ‘map’, you can see where the hotel is – look for one
towards the south of the centre.

Some hotels listed there which look suitable are:

* The Grassmarket Hotel
  This one may be quite loud (the Grassmarket is a popular drinking area), but seems quite cheap, and is 10 minutes’ walk from the conference venue 

* Jurys Inn
  This is in the ugliest building in Edinburgh, but it’s probably fine as a hotel (about 15 mins’ walk) 

* Royal British Hotel
  Very central in Edinburgh, maybe a little jaded (about 20 mins’ walk) 

* Ten Hill Place Hotel
  Recommended, if a bit more expensive (very close to the conference) 

* Ibis Edinburgh Centre
  Fine if faceless (about 10 mins’ walk) 

* Express By Holiday Inn Edinburgh Royal Mile
  Looks fine but may be a bit loud (about 10 mins’ walk) 

* Travelodge Edinburgh Central
  Faceless but probably fine (about 15 mins’ walk) 

* Apex City Hotel
  May be quite loud (it’s on the Grassmarket), but seems quite nice (about 10 mins’ walk) 

* Radisson SAS
  More pricey, but meant to be nice, well situated (about 10 mins’ walk) 

### Hostels ###

The cheapest option would be to stay at one of the many hostels in Edinburgh. These have some very cheap accommodation, and several have private rooms, too. There are a number of
hostel searching websites, which should help you to see what’s available, and to book accommodation:

* [hostelbookers](http://www.hostelbooker.com)
* [hostelworld](http://www.hostelworld.com/hostels/Edinburgh) 
* [hostels.com](http://www.hostels.com)

There are hostels all over Edinburgh. The following, listed on the hostel websites above, are all quite close (10-15 minutes’ walk) to the conference venue:

* Budget Backpackers 
* Castle Rock Hostel 
* Argyle Backpackers 
* Royal Mile Backpackers 
* smartcityhostels Edinburgh 
* Euro Hostel Edinburgh Halls 
* Edinburgh Backpackers 
* St Christopher’s 

The [main YHA hostel in Edinburgh](https://www.syha.org.uk/where-to-stay/lowlands/edinburgh-central.aspx) is new and looks nice, although it’s a bit of a distance from the conference (30 minutes’ walk). There are lots of buses, though.

## Central Edinburgh ##

Central Edinburgh is made up of the New Town, to the north, and the
Old Town, to the south, with Princes Street and (Princes Street
Gardens) in between. Most of the buildings of the University of
Edinburgh (including the symposium venue) are in the Old Town, towards
the south. You should make sure that you have the chance to walk round
the city while you’re here – it’s stunning. Walk up and down the Royal
Mile to the castle at the top and the Scottish Parliament at the
bottom, walk around the New Town (which starts at Princes Street and
carries on northwards for several streets), or walk up Calton Hill and
around Holyrood Park.

The symposium coincides with the
[Edinburgh Christmas Market](http://www.edinburghschristmas.com),
which is well worth a visit.

You can find some information about Edinburgh here:

* the [Lonely Planet website for Edinburgh](http://www.lonelyplanet.com/scotland/edinburgh) has some general information about the city 
* the [Edinburgh Tourist Information website](http://www.edinburgh.org/) also has some handy information about the city
