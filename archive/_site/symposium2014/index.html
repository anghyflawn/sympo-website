<h3><a name="background"></a><span style="color: red;">Background</span></h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">2014 should see the publication
of the <a href="http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199232819.do#.UgTEwn43YXx"><span style="font-style: italic;">Oxford Handbook of Historical Phonology</span></a>.
In part to celebrate this, and in part because Historical Phonology is
inherently worth celebrating, we are organising a Symposium on
Historical Phonology, to be held at the University of Edinburgh on 13th
and 14th January 2014. <br>
<br>
The Handbook aims to gather together perspectives on phonological
change
and on the reconstruction of past phonological states from across the
discipline. The table of contents is available <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/homes/patrick/hphhndbk-toc.pdf">here</a>.
Contributors to the Handbook have been invited to attend the symposium,
and a call for papers was issued for poster presentations from anyone
else interested in attending the symposium. The intention is for the
event to be organised
informally but to involve serious discussion of theoretical and
practical issues in Historical Phonology. <br>
<ul></ul>

The symposium is in part sponsored by <a href="http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/">Oxford University Press</a> and by the <a href="http://www.ppls.ed.ac.uk/groups/english-language-research-group-1">Angus McIntosh Centre for Historical Linguistics</a>.<small><br>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a name="prog"></a><span style="color: red;">Programme </span><br>
</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The programme for the symposium (with
some practical information about registration, wifi and food and drink) is available here:<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="sympo-prog.pdf">programme</a><br>
  </li>
</ul>The abstracts for the poster session (the talks are all invited so do not have abstracts) are available here:<br>
<ul>
  
  <li><a href="sympo-abbk.pdf">abstracts booklet</a><br>
  </li>

</ul>

The list of participants is available here:<br>

<ul>
  <li><a href="sympo-people.pdf">participant list</a></li>
</ul>There will be a pre-conference drink at <a href="http://www.nicholsonspubs.co.uk/greyfriarsbobbysbarcandlemakerrowedinburgh/">Greyfriars Bobby’s Bar</a> from about 8pm on Sunday 12th January for anyone in Edinburgh that night who would like to come.<br>

<br>
<span style="color: red;">Advice for speakers:</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>the slots are 30 minutes long, including question time</li>
  <li>you can choose whether you'd rather have 20 minutes to speak and
10 minutes for questions or 25 minutes to speak and 5 minutes for
questions</li>
  <li>there are around 65 people registered for, so you're unikely to need more handouts than that<br>
  </li>

  <li>data projection facilities will be available at the venue, and we can supply a laptop if you need one</li>
  <li>if you have any specific requirements for your presentation, let us know (<a href="mailto:patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk">patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk</a>)</li>
</ul>
<span style="color: red;">Advice for poster presenters:</span><br>

<ul>
<li>the poster displays will be set up just before each poster session,
so do please be ready to put it up during the time indicated as
'putting up posters' on the programme</li>
  <li>the advice on size for your poster is not to go larger than size A0</li>
  <li>you could either produce one big poster of that size, or a series
of smaller sheets which can be fitted together on the poster board<br>
  </li>
  <li>the general advice is: make sure that the font size is not too
small, that it is easily readable and does not have too much text on
it, that it sets out the main points that you want to argue for
clearly, and maybe that it's eye catching, too</li>
  <li>we will provide you with the means that you'll need to put up your poster<br>
  </li>
  <li>during your poster session, you will be asked to stand by your
poster (for at least a fair amount of the session) as other
participants walk around the displays, read your posters and ask you
questions about them</li>
  <li>feel free to bring a handout for people to take away with them, too<br>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a name="booking"></a><span style="color: red;">Booking</span></h3>


There is a fee of <span style="color: red;">£15</span> to attend the
symposium for those who are not invited speakers. This covers the coffee breaks
and all other events at the symposium apart from an evening meal which we are organising at a
restaurant on 13th January. All participants at the symposium are
welcome to attend this, but it costs extra: another <span style="color: red;">£15</span>.
If you would like to attend the symposium, you will need to register
and pay the symposium fee (and the cost of the evening meal if you
would like to come to that) before December 16th. <br>
<br>
This is how to
register and pay:<br>

<ul>
<li>email <a href="mailto:patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk">patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk</a> with your name and academic affiliation and a note of whether you would like to book for the evening meal<br>
  </li><li>we will send you the details of how to pay - this will offer an opportunity to pay by credit card</li><li>please remember to register by 10am (UTC/GMT) on the <span style="color: red;">16th December</span><br>
  </li>

</span></h3>



The event will be held in the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/maps?building=informatics-forum">Informatics Forum</a> and <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/maps?building=dugald-stewart-building">Dugald Stewart Building</a>, which are both part of the university's central area. Edinburgh is well connected through <a href="http://www.edinburghairport.com/">Edinburgh Airport</a> and the <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">UK rail system</a>,
and the university's central area is easily accessible, on the edge of
Edinburgh's remarkable Old Town, a few minutes' walk from the Royal
Mile. <a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/">Edinburgh</a> is the ancient capital of Scotland, and its Old Town and (18th century) New Town form a large <a href="http://www.ewht.org.uk/">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>. The University is
easily accessible from anywhere in the city, and is within walking
distance of the train station and all the city centre shops and
restaurants. A map is available <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/maps/?building=informatics-forum">here</a> - this shows where the Informatics Forum is, which is where the talks and posters will be held. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting to the symposium from the airport and city centre</span><br>
For most people, travelling to the Symposium will involve either flying into or getting the train to
Edinburgh and then either walking or getting a bus or a taxi to the
conference venue (or to your accommodation first, perhaps). It's easy
to get into the city centre from <a href="http://www.edinburghairport.com/">Edinburgh airport</a>: use the <a href="http://lothianbuses.com/services/airlink">number 100
Airlink bus</a> which leaves every few minutes and which drops you off next
to the main train station (this is the last stop on the bus journey).
This station (called Waverley Station) is where most intercity trains
terminate, too.<br>
<br>
Waverley station is a good orientation point -
it's situated right in the centre of the city, between the New Town and
the Old Town, just next to Princes Street (Princes Street is the main
central shopping street in Edinburgh), and there are normally lots of
taxis available at the station (if you want to take a taxi to the
conference venue, ask them to take to the Informatics Forum at the
University, next to Bristo Square). It's about 15 minutes' walk from
the station to the University. You need to head south: walk up from the
station into the Old Town along Cockburn Street and then up the Royal
Mile and along George IV bridge. The Informatics Forum is shown on a map <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/maps?building=informatics-forum">here</a>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Accommodation</span><br>

If you need to book accommodation for the symposium, we <span style="color: red;">recommend</span> trying the <a href="http://www.edinburghfirst.co.uk/for-accommodation/kenneth-mackenzie">Kenneth
Mackenzie Suite</a>
or <a href="http://www.edinburghfirst.co.uk/for-accommodation/richmond-place-apartments">Richmond Apartments</a> (these are both affiliated to the university and
are close to the symposium venue and city centre - the invited speakers
are staying there). There *may* be some crash accommodation available - if you'd like to investigate this, email us (<a href="mailto:patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk">patrick.honeybone@ed.ac.uk</a>). The university also has some <a href="http://www.book.accom.ed.ac.uk/">other types of accommodation</a> at other nearby locations, which may also be worth investigating.<br>

<br>

If they are full, or you'd like to stay somewhere more luxurious or
cheaper, the easiest way to find somewhere is to use one of the many
internet accommodation search sites. If you try&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g186525-Edinburgh_Scotland-Hotels.html">Trip
Advisor</a>, you'll find lots of details and some interesting
comments about the
hotels (not always to be trusted, but you can
probably go by the average opinion). Enter your&nbsp;check-in and
check-out dates<o:p>, </o:p>
select the number of adults staying in the room and&nbsp;click on
'find hotels'. You can&nbsp;select the currency that you'd like to
use and&nbsp;you can 'sort by' price or popularity. If you click on
'map', you can see where the hotel is - look for one towards the south of
the centre<o:p>.</o:p> <br>
<br>
Some <span style="color: red;">hotels</span> listed there which look suitable are:

<ul>
  <li>The
Grassmarket Hotel<br>
This one may be quite loud (the Grassmarket is a popular drinking area), but seems quite cheap, and is 10 minutes'
walk from the conference venue </li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li><o:p></o:p>Jurys Inn<st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on"></st1:place></st1:city><br>

This is in the ugliest building in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Edinburgh</st1:city></st1:place>,
but it's probably fine as a hotel (about 15 mins' walk)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>Royal British Hotel<br>
Very central in Edinburgh, maybe a little jaded (about 20 mins' walk)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Ten Hill Place Hotel<br>
Looks fine (very close to the conference)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li><o:p></o:p>Ibis Edinburgh
Centre<br>

Fine if faceless (about 10 mins' walk)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>Express
By Holiday Inn <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Edinburgh</st1:place></st1:city>
Royal Mile<br>
Looks fine but may be a bit loud (about 10 mins' walk)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
Travelodge Edinburgh
Central<br>
Faceless but probably fine&nbsp;(about 15 mins' walk)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li><o:p></o:p>Apex City Hotel<br>

May be quite loud (it's on the Grassmarket), but seems quite nice (about 10 mins' walk)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
  <li>Radisson SAS<br>
More pricey, but meant to be nice, well situated (about 10 mins' walk)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">

<span style="color: red;">Hostels</span><br>

The cheapest
option&nbsp;would be to stay at one of the many hostels in Edinburgh. These have
some
very cheap accommodation, and several have private rooms, too. There are a
number of hostel searching websites, which should help you to see
what's available, and to book accommodation<a href="http://www.hostelbookers.com/hostels/scotland/edinburgh/"><o:p><span style="color: black;">:</span></o:p></a></p>

</ul>




<p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">There
are hostels all over Edinburgh.
The following, listed on the hostel websites above, are all quite close
(10-15 minutes' walk) to the
conference venue: <o:p></o:p></p>

The main <a href="http://syha.org.uk/hostels-in-scotland/lowlands/edinburgh-central.aspx">YHA hostel in Edinburgh</a><a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/hostels/Edinburgh"></a>
is new and looks nice, although it's a bit of a distance from the
conference (30 minutes' walk). There are lots of buses, though.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Central Edinburgh</span><br>
Central
Edinburgh is made up of the New Town, to the north, and the Old Town,
to the south, with Princes Street and (Princes Street Gardens) in
between. Most of the buildings of the University of Edinburgh
(including the symposium venue) are in the Old Town, towards the
south. You should make sure that you have the chance to walk round the
city while you're here - it's stunning. Walk up and down the Royal Mile
to the castle at the top and the Scottish Parliament at the bottom,
walk around the New Town (which starts at Princes Street and carries on
northwards for several streets), or walk up Calton Hill and around
Holyrood Park. You can find some information about Edinburgh here:<br>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/scotland/edinburgh">Lonely Planet website for Edinburgh</a> has some general information about the city </li><li>the <a href="http://www.edinburgh.org/">Edinburgh Tourist Information website</a> also has some handy information about the city<br>

A note on dates: We have no flexibility in terms of when the
symposium is to be held - 13-14 January are the only possible dates for
a number of practical reasons. This means that the symposium will occur
before the
print version of the Handbook appears. We still intend to celebrate the
volume and to launch it into the world at the symposium, however, and
we anticipate that chapters will be available in the web-based version
of the Handbook by then.&nbsp; The dates just avoid clashing with other
important phonological events: the <a href="http://linguistlist.org/issues/24/24-2441.html">CUNY Phonology
Forum Conference on Weight in Phonology and Phonetics</a> and the <a href="http://linguistlist.org/issues/24/24-1859.html">11th Old World
