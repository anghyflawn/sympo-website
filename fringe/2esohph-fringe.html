<h3><a name="background"></a>Background</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Given that there will be a number
of people who are interested in historical phonology in Edinburgh the
day before the <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/symposium-on-historical-phonology/">Second
Edinburgh Symposium on Historical Phonology</a>,
we thought that we
could make use of this to hold a satellite workshop on the fringes of
the symposium devoted to the
history of the discipline. This workshop is
intended to be a relatively informal venue for
discussion of a number of issues related to the history of historical
phonology, and all the speakers in the
session were invited to take part. It is not a formal part of the symposium and
everyone is welcome to
attend. <br>

<br>
<h3><a name="topic"></a>Topic</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;">There has long been serious work on
historical phonology (for two centuries at least). Perhaps because it
is a 'historical' discipline itself, historical phonology has always
been aware of its own origins, and practitioners are typically
interested in the ways in which it has developed over its own history,
in the reasons for those developments, and in the ways in which they
lead, or have been led by, developments in general phonological (and morphophonological) theory.
This session is intended as an opportunity to focus on strands in the
(ancient and/or recent) development of historical phonology - how did
things develop? And why?<br>

</ul>We advise you to arrive just before the session starts - maybe
around 1.20pm, although you'd be welcome to come in at any point if you
arrive late. There will not be much provided in the way of refreshments
during the break (it's free to attend, after all...), but it will be
possible to go and get a coffee at a nearby cafe.

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a name="attending"></a>Attending</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">It is free to attend the workshop. It is being held in a building close to where the <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/symposium-on-historical-phonology/">Symposium on Historical
Phonology</a> will be held, in the central campus of the University of
Edinburgh, but the two events are not in the same building. <br>
<br>
This is where the workshop will be:<br>
<ul>
  <li>room 1.06 in 27 George Square - click <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/maps/?building=16-27-george-square">here</a> to find the building on a campus map</li>
  <li>postcode for finding the building in phones and the like: EH8 9LD</li>
  <li>this link <a href="http://www.docs.csg.ed.ac.uk/EstatesBuildings/Development/Access%20Guides/27-29%20George%20Square%20Guide%20to%20Access%20%282%29.pdf">here</a> will take you to far more information that you could possibly need about the building<br>
  </li>

</ul>You can orient yourself by going to the university's main city
centre
campus and looking for George Square, which is a square
of grass and trees, surrounded by university buildings (inclduing the
library - 27 George Square is very close to the library). The symposium
itself (on Thursday 3rd and Friday 4th) will be held in the Informatics
Forum, which is at one corner of
George Square, and this workshop is on the other side of George Square
in a building which looks like an old Edinburgh tenement block. The
building and room will
be signposted on the day.

<a name="cser"></a> <span style="font-style: italic;">The problem of abstractness in
nineteenth-century phonology and morphology</span><br>
Andras Cser<br>
<br>
This talk looks at the transition from the framework of the comparative
and historical linguistics of the early and mid-19th century to that of
the later 19th century from two interrelated aspects, both essential to
this transition, which is commonly referred to as the Neogrammarian
revolution. One of these aspects is how the study of sounds and sound
changes on the one hand, and how morphology on the other, related to
each other. The other aspect is how abstraction and fact-oriented
empiricism related to each other. These questions are interesting
primarily because important shifts took place in the 1870's in both
respects.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span><a name="pierce"></a> <span style="font-style: italic;">Towards a Historiography of 'Morphologically Conditioned Sound Changes'<br>
</span>Marc Pierce<br>

<br>
One of the more controversial ideas that emerged in historical
linguistics in the 1960s and 1970s was that of "morphologically
conditioned sound changes." While Neogrammarians like Paul (1920) and
Structuralists like Bloomfield (1933) had argued that sound change was
exclusively conditioned by phonetic/phonological factors, some
generativists (e.g. Postal 1968) rejected this claim in favor of the
idea that sound change could also be morphologically conditioned. In
this paper, I situate this idea within the history of historical
linguistics in the 1960s and 1970s, focusing on generative approaches
to historical linguistics.<br>
<br>
While the idea of "morphologically conditioned sound changes" clearly
resonated with many historical linguists at the time (e.g., King 1969
and Anttila 1972 endorse the idea in their influential books, and
Cathey 1972 applies it to the famously messy phenomenon of Old Norse
i-umlaut), this idea was not unanimously accepted. Jasanoff (1971: 81),
for instance, concedes that "in synchronic grammars there is a very
real need for such rules," as in Greek, where s is deleted
intervocalically except in the future and aorist of verbs, but argues
that in diachronic terms they are better treated as the results of
regular sound change that has been (partially) obscured by analogy.
More recent work on historical linguistics has also moved away from
this idea somewhat. For instance, Sihler (2000: 43) distinguishes
between sound changes and analogical changes, which hints that he would
reject the idea of morphologically conditioned sound changes, but
states that, in the case of Greek s mentioned above, "it remains a
topic of debate whether this is a 'therapeutic analogy' – that is, an
innovation that restored intervocalic *s after it was lost – or instead
involved a continuous adjustment that prevented the consonant from
being lost in the first place." Additionally, Campbell (2013) reviews
several possible examples of this type of sound change and concludes
only that "[a]t this stage of our understanding, we cannot ignore any
potential causal factor ... and thus cut off inquiry before we arrive
at a fuller picture of how and why changes occur." (Campbell 2013: 335).<br>
<br>
The development of the idea of morphologically conditioned sound change
can be traced a number of currents in the field. Among others, it
reflects (1) the increasing application of generative linguistics to
historical linguistics and (2) the increasing emphasis within
phonological theory on rules over representations. At the same time, it
should not be forgotten that some earlier scholars had noted the
possible connection between morphology and sound change. Sapir (1921:
152) had suggested that "I am inclined to believe that our present
tendency to isolate phonetics and grammar as mutually irrelevant
linguistic provinces is unfortunate.... After all, if speech-sounds
exist merely because they are the symbolic carriers of significant
concepts and groupings of concepts, why may not a strong drift or a
permanent feature in the conceptual sphere exercise a furthering or a
retarding influence on the phonetic drift?" Additionally, Wessén
(1918) had somewhat tentatively applied the idea to Old Norse i-umlaut
as well, indicating that the idea was simultaneously cutting-edge and
old-fashioned.<br>

<a name="dresher"></a> <span style="font-style: italic;">A history of contrastive feature hierarchies in Germanic diachronic phonology<br>
</span>B. Elan Dresher <br>

<br>
In this talk I will look at the origins and uses of contrastive
hierarchies in Germanic diachronic phonology, with a focus on the
development of West Germanic vowel systems. I will begin with a rather
enigmatic remark in Richard Hogg’s A grammar of Old English (1992), and
attempt to trace its provenance. We will find that the trail leads back
to analyses by some prominent scholars that make use of contrastive
feature hierarchies. However, these analyses often appear without
context or supporting framework. I will attempt to provide the missing
framework and historical context for these analyses, while showing
their value for understanding the development of phonological systems.
I will show that behind these apparently isolated analyses there is a
substantial theoretical edifice that once held a central role in
synchronic as well as diachronic phonological theory. <br>
